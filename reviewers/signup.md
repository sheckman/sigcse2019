## Reviewer Signup

SIGCSE uses a community reviewing process, and we encourage you to participate. New reviewers are always wanted, and it is one of the best ways you can contribute to the conference and help ensure a strong and diverse program. We invite you to sign up to be a reviewer this year! Just fill out this form to sign up as a volunteer:

  <a href = "https://goo.gl/8H1cv6">https://goo.gl/8H1cv6</a>
</div>

<b>But what if the paper deadline has passed</b>? Don't worry, we still need reviewing volunteers for the second submission deadline, for posters, demos, lightning talks, and BOFs. So don't hesitate to sign up. We'll also keep your information for next year, so you can be invited to review again. Thank you for serving in this important community support role!

The Program Co-Chairs will periodically send out EasyChair invitations to volunteers for reviewing roles where additional people are needed.
