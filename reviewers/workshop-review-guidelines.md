## SIGCSE 2019 Workshop Review Guidelines

Workshops provide an in-depth review of, or introduction to, a topic of interest, and should provide participants with materials and/or ideas that are immediately useful in the classroom. To this end, workshop presenters should provide participants with handouts, online materials, or other tangible documents/ artifacts outlining and/or supporting the workshop material.

**Workshop proposals undergo review but not blind review**. Proposals are evaluated for relevance, anticipated interest, quality, and availability of appropriate facilities. In addition, feedback on, and attendance at, similar workshops that have been offered in previous years may be taken into account. This is particularly relevant for workshops that propose repeating or extending a previously offered workshop. Authors may want to review the list of workshops accepted in previous years before submitting a proposal.

SIGCSE workshop proposals are reviewed using EasyChair. Authors submit a workshop proposal by {{site.data.cfp.track1.date}}. Assigned reviewers submit their anonymous reviews through EasyChair by the review deadline ({{site.data.cfp.reviewend}}), making a recommendation along with a rationale using the conference review form in EasyChair. Each workshop proposal is assigned to at least three reviewers.

Dates for notification of acceptance and camera-ready submission can be found on the detail page for each specific submission type.
