        Hands-on learning is often the best teacher, especially for computer science students who need exposure to various systems and software. Come join this interactive session to learn how easy it is to create classroom labs in Azure. Azure Lab Services is a service that enables educators to easily create labs of virtual machines in Azure, without having to master the complexities of setting up cloud infrastructure.
        
        As educators, you can specify the exact machine setup you want to roll out to your students. You can spin up/tear down classroom labs on demand. Minimize costs by monitoring and controlling the usage of the machines. Students go to a single place to access all the virtual machines they are given across multiple labs, and connect from there to do day-to-day work, short-term projects, or classroom exercises.
        
        We will provide live demos and open the room for discussions.

        CodeLab is an online, automated, interactive learning tool for students in programming courses. The CodeLab service provides hundreds of very short, focused coding exercises that help students gain mastery over the syntax, semantics and common usage patterns of language constructs and programming ideas. Code submissions for each exercise are automatically checked for correctness and students are given relevant hints in case of incorrect code.
        
        Building on this platform, Turing's Craft has introduced a highly flexible, comprehensive, easy-to use system that allows faculty to create their own auto-graded homework programming projects, with support for individualized grading and student-instructor communication. It's easier than ever for instructors to build, assign, establish due dates for, and optionally review any programming assignment. Projects may vary from fragments of code to full programs that involve both interactive and file i/o.
        
        This session completely illustrates the process of creating, deploying, and grading homework projects.

        Dr. Dan Wallach was looking for a scalable, reliable solution for his course: In 2015 the peak loads from his students’ work crashed their campus Subversion server, forcing them to extend their deadlines and ultimately run a private server, requiring significant assistance from Rice’s IT group. So he tried GitHub Classroom in 2017, and now uses for his 200-level course at Rice University. 
        
        Dr. Paul Salvador Inventado has 60 - 120 students per semester at California State University, Fullerton, and that’s a lot of checking. Inventado combines the use of a unit-testing framework with GitHub Classroom to automate the automatables: problem assignment, feedback, and checking. His research focuses on problem set generation, unit-testing, and machine learning. He is also a certified GitHub Campus Advisor.

        "Programming is hard, but all the logins are harder" -- Said by a UCR student

        Instructors often don't realize how complex CS courses have become ("feature creep"). zyBooks provide an outstanding interactive textbook, auto-grading homework system, and program auto-grader, all seamlessly integrated into ONE platform (with only one login -- or none via LMS integration). That's a key reason nearly all faculty come back, and why students ask to access our zyBooks even if their professor is using a different book. We'll show how our comprehensive solution leads to smooth courses that students love -- even if hard.
        
        "I enjoy grading programs" -- Said by nobody
        
        CS is experiencing explosive growth, which pushes our grading resources to the limit. Auto-grading saves huge amounts of time. Students get more practice and immediate feedback, so they can improve quickly. We've learned how to do auto-grading even better, like with automated hints in homework problems, or using many small programs in CS1. We'll show how easy it is to create auto-graded programming assignments, and tell you about our large set of zyBooks-maintained labs -- so you can focus on the parts of teaching you really enjoy.

        This session will describe ABET’s recently updated program evaluation criteria for computer science and related programs.  Attendees from currently accredited programs will learn about significant changes to ABET’s program evaluation criteria impacting computer science program reviews conducted in the 2019-2020 academic year and beyond. Attendees from institutions considering program accreditation will learn about the value of ABET accreditation to schools, students, and employers.
        
        ABET’s updated computing criteria reflects recent developments in computing disciplines as reflected in ACM and IEEE Computer Society curriculum guidelines, including the Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science (CS2013).  While focusing on criteria specific to computer science programs, we will also touch on the changes affecting all computing programs in general.  We also will offer advice on transitioning from ABET’s current criteria to its new criteria for programs seeking reaccreditation in the next few years.
