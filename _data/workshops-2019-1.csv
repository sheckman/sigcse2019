Join us for an overview of three departments' approaches to serving non-CS-majors. Those who bring laptops are invited to try out facets of the curricula. Opportunities to plan for the post-CS-major future are open to all.,"CS majors are certainly not disappearing, but the interest and demand for computing from non-CS majors is a far larger part of our future, as members of CS departments, than those on the disciplinary-major path. As computing evolves from valuable specialty to a professional literacy, CS departments face several challenges. How do we support both the traditional CS-major path and provide computing curriculum to a far broader audience? How do we partner with sibling departments in order to foster their sense of ownership and identity with computing's mindsets and toolsets? And, perhaps especially poignant in 2018, how do we invest energy into the CS-for-All future during a time that demand in our major pathway is at historic highs? This workshop features three faculty members who have tried to answer these questions within the context of their departments. This workshop will share the results of those experiments, will offer hands-on exploration of a representative subset of the curricular materials, and will scaffold a strategic discussion of CS's future and identity in the era of ""CS for All.""

What if there was a better way to do grading that actually measured student learning outcomes, caused less arguments, and took less time? Well, there is and it’s called specifications grading. This workshop will explain what specifications grading is and give you an opportunity to apply these techniques to the actual computer science courses that you teach. Please bring one or more of your current syllabi and/or assignment instructions with you to this interactive workshop. You will leave the workshop with a plan to modify at least one of your courses. You will also receive a set of handouts and sample materials created by the presenters.","As proposed by Linda B. Nilson in Specifications Grading: Restoring Rigor, Motivating Students, and Saving Faculty Time, specifications grading is an assessment construct that relies on pass/fail grading of assignments and assessments, the structuring of course content into modules linked to learning outcomes, and the bundling of assignments and assessments within those modules. One of the intentions of this type of course grading construct is to more closely align assessment with student attainment of intended learning outcomes. While there has been very visible work in incorporating specifications grading in some academic areas (e.g. in mathematics), examples of the use of specifications grading in computer science courses are less common. The goal of this workshop is to introduce the concepts of specifications grading, explain how to apply these concepts to a wide range of computing courses, and have the participants apply these concepts to one of their current or upcoming computer science courses. Each participant should leave the workshop with at least one revised course syllabus or assignment that incorporates specifications grading."

Take home knowledge, curricular ideas, and a crafted textile of your own design.","This reprise of a highly successful SIGCSE 2018 workshop provides a novel perspective on : skills that are often labeled ‘women’s work’ are the foundational principles of computer science developed from textile crafts. The 'Code Crafters' curriculum, which expands Andrea Mayer’s Snap-based TurtleStitch embroidery programming project, is being successfully taught in 3 ways: as a full semester undergraduate course, as a weeklong summer workshop for middle and high school students, and as a half day event. The SIGCSE workshop will introduce participants to potential adaptations of this curriculum, report on its use as both a CS 0, and CS 1 course, and give participants hands-on experience in designing and rendering a machine embroidery pattern in TurtleStitch and Processing Stitch (Java). Key concepts from the full semester curriculum will be demonstrated: (1) crocheting as a vehicle for learning about primitive operations instruction codes for process control, and reading and writing patterns (algorithms); (2) programing machine embroidery provides exposure to agile design; (3) contrasting embroidery with quilting provides experience in abstraction and reuse; (4) weaving and tapestry provide concrete illustrations of manipulating two dimensional data structures; (5) studying embroidery machine file formats demonstrates how language translation takes place; (6) sharing a limited resource (a $500 programmable, single thread machine) provides concrete experience in scheduling, and product testing; (7) collaborative crochet and quilted projects provide experience in team dynamics. Participants in this workshop will be invited to join an online community of mutual support."

Are you flummoxed by the lack of adoption your idea has achieved despite your best efforts? Do you wish you could convince your department to try a new pedagogy, curriculum, or other innovation? You should attend our CS Education Innovation Propagation Planning Workshop! Learn about best practices for propagation planning throughout STEM and in CS specifically, get feedback on your plan, and refine your approach to increase adoption. ","In CS, educational innovation is constant, but many great ideas never achieve the type of widespread adoption necessary to make lasting and effective change to the way we teach and learn. Research across STEM education has shown that propagation planning is often an overlooked or undervalued part of educational innovation. Whether promoting our own project or an outside innovation, barriers to success are more difficult to overcome when encountered without sufficient preparation. Plans for adoption and scaling of innovations are not one-size-fits-all, but there are lessons we can learn from both successful and unsuccessful previous projects. We will present a summary of these lessons based on our recent ITiCSE working group research experience on the topic. This writing workshop will focus on building propagation plans informed by best practices and within the context of individual project definitions of success. We will work in small groups to identify potential barriers to the success of our projects, learn about best practices for overcoming those barriers, and put in place a measurable and actionable plan for adoption and propagation. Participants will work toward a better plan for propagation while garnering advice from their peers, learning and generating new ideas about and methods for dissemination and adoption, and building a community of resources for future collaboration, champions for change, and peer feedback."

You'll get a chance to experiment with Amazon Web Services (AWS) free tier products that allow building software from the comfort of a web browser. Why AWS? Well, because AWS has established itself as the front-runner in the cloud computing market. Participants are expected to create an AWS account (https://aws.amazon.com/free/) at least 48 hours before the workshop (registration is free but you must provide credit card information). Prerequisites: familiarity with Python programming, web development, and basic Linux commands. Please bring your own laptop computer (any OS) with WiFi access and a modern web browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended).","A microservice architecture decomposes the entire functionally of an application into a set of services that can be deployed and scaled independently. Each service does only one job and does it well. Thus, it's simpler to develop, test and maintain. Additionally, it has its own database and provides access to datasets and services through a well-defined application programming interface (API). Highly successful Internet companies, such as Amazon, Netflix, and Twitter, use microservice architectures to build their software. This workshop is aimed at CS instructors that wish to teach students how to design and build microservice-based applications using cloud services and products provided by the Amazon Web Services (AWS) free tier. We'll start creating a cloud development environment with the AWS Cloud9 IDE. Afterwards, we'll code in Python several RESTful web services using AWS Lambda functions, which are serverless cloud computing services that are executed in response to events. The advantage of going serverless is that you build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. Your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by AWS. Finally, we'll demonstrate how to persist our information in a NoSQL database using the Amazon DynamoDB service.

Participate in a discussion on integrating cyber security into liberal arts general education and paths your students can follow to enter a career in the field.  Please bring a laptop with a browser and an ssh client installed.,"The primary purpose of this workshop is to help undergraduate liberal arts colleges integrate cyber security seamlessly into the curriculum with little to no additional investment. We believe Liberal Arts Colleges can provide to the cyber security workforce well-rounded individuals equipped to tackle new and complex problems. However, liberal arts colleges rarely have the resources needed to provide the hands-on labs critical to attracting students to cyber security classes and for preparing students for the workforce. Our NSF funded project “CyberPaths” addresses this by devising several active learning labs on topics such as ransomware, authentication, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), and remote network attacks. These labs are implemented on the cloud infrastructure GENI, an NSF funded free academic cloud infrastructure for realistic networking experimentation. The labs are suitable for non-CS majors as well as CS upper level courses. In addition, we propose interdisciplinary cyber security modules and multiple paths that can lead to the cyber security professions, starting from the general education courses, moving to an intro to cyber security course, and upper level CS courses. Our goal is to offer solutions to liberal arts institutions with cyber security active learning and introducing cyber security early in the curriculum with low overhead. This workshop will be highly interactive using a combination of hands-on labs and discussions.

Most of their favorite applications use vast numbers of distributed processors. Why are we still teaching them to solve problems using only sequential thinking? Come to this workshop to see how easy it is to open their eyes to exploiting concurrency in problem solving, starting in their earliest courses. You'll hear about and experience some unplugged activities, learn how to help students recognize examples of concurrency in the world around them, see how event driven user interfaces can easily exemplify issues related to multithreading, and how freely available libraries can be used to naturally exploit parallelism in working with large data structures. Having a laptop that can run Java and C++ will allow you to follow along with some code examples, but isn't necessary. ","Parallel and distributed computing (PDC) is now a pervasive aspect of deployed systems, and thus it is essential that students include parallelism and distribution in the computational thinking that they apply to problem solving, from the very beginning. In some cases, concurrency actually offers simpler solutions than sequential approaches. In this workshop we overview the key PDC concepts that have been identified through our curriculum work, and give several examples of how they may naturally be incorporated in common existing courses in the first two years of a typical CS program, including unplugged activities.

The first in the suite is CS50 Sandbox, a web app at sandbox.cs50.io that enables teachers and students to create temporary programming environments quickly, without even logging in, and share copies of those sandboxes with others. With this app can a teacher start programs in class that students can then finish, distribute starter code for problems, and post interactive solutions. The second tool in the suite is CS50 Lab, a web app at lab.cs50.io that enables teachers to create step-by-step programming lessons, providing incremental feedback at each step, and enables students to progress from an empty file (or starter code) to working code, with hints and feedback along the way. Via this app can teachers author their own Codecademy-style lessons using just a GitHub repo of their own. The third tool in the suite is CS50 IDE, a web app at cs50.io built atop Cloud9 that provides students with their own cloud-based Linux environment. Each of these environments offers a built-in file browser and code editor and, most importantly, an interactive terminal window with shell access to their very own container.

409,765,"Saturday, March 2, 3:00 pm - 6:00 pm",Mark Lewis,Big Data Analytics with Spark,"The role of big data in industry continues to grow. It is a driving force behind many of the advances in machine learning and deep learning and some knowledge of it should be part of any serious data science program. The term “big data” gets used in a lot of situations, but to really be appropriate you need to be talking about datasets and analyses that can’t be done on a single machine and hence require a cluster of machines. While MapReduce and Hadoop drove the initial growth in big data, Spark is currently the king of the big data frameworks. The goal of this workshop is to introduce educators to Apache Spark and how it can be used to do big data processing on clusters in a manner that is approachable by upper-division undergraduate students. Unlike Hadoop’s implementation of MapReduce, Spark is highly accessible to students. While it can be run on large cloud clusters, and providers like AWS and Google Cloud provide support for it, it is also trivial to run on a small cluster at your school and can even run locally on student machines with smaller datasets. This workshop will give participants hands-on experience using that last option.","Born from a Berkeley graduate project, the Apache Spark library has grown to be the most broadly used big data analytics platform for big data. While Spark integrates with the older Hadoop ecosystem, it provides much more intuitive, faster, and powerful abstractions for manipulating distributed data than MapReduce. In this workshop, we will cover the basics of the Spark library with the goal of getting participants up to speed so that they can use the library or teach it in courses that involve big data or distributed processing. Participants will work with examples that range from calculating basic summary statistics to using the Spark Machine Learning library for performing sophisticated machine learning analyses on large datasets. Tasks during the session will be performed on smaller samples using the Spark local standalone implementation on participant’s laptops. We will also discuss how Spark can be run on a local or cloud-based cluster and point participants toward resources for setting up those environments for their students."

We will share our experience and ideas in offering such courses to our campuses, providing resources to help the faculty member new to this area or looking to refresh his or her approach.","This tutorial will provide a foundation for faculty members either teaching a course in artificial intelligence for the first time or renewing a course that has been dormant. The growing ubiquity of AI and machine learning dictates that departments offer a course in this area, regardless of whether any such expertise exists locally. Furthermore, there are many possible approaches, from a general overview to a tight focus on a particular application area, either as a single elective or a specialization area within an undergraduate degree. An increasingly wide range of resources is available, but intelligent selection from the plethora of information can be a challenge, particularly in smaller programs where no local expertise is available. The tutorial is in two parts. Part 1 focuses on background knowledge, discussing major divisions within the broad field of AI, research trends and application areas, and commonly used tools. Part 2 addresses classroom implementation, assessment, textbook options, and online resources including code libraries, free-to-use data sets, development environments, and visualization tools. Participants will have the opportunity to brainstorm and discuss options for course focus. Sample syllabi using differing course approaches, sample exams and assignments, and a non-exhaustive list of useful resources will be provided. "
