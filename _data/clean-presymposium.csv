2/27/2019,8:30 AM,6:30 PM,Pre-Symposium,RESPECT/RPPforCS,Millenium: Grand Ballroom,"<p>Understanding how to apply fundamental computer science problem solving skills is quickly becoming a required competency. It is critical to address issues of equity and inclusion so that we can engage all people in learning key concepts in computing. The Fourth Annual Conference on Research in Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology (RESPECT) is intended to serve a premier venue for peer-reviewed research on broadening participation in computing. Since broadening participation research is inherently interdisciplinary, we invite contributions from computer science education, educational leadership, learning sciences, cognitive or social psychology, social sciences, and related disciplines. All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and contain an analysis of effectiveness. Research papers should adhere to rigorous standards, describing hypotheses, methods, and results. Experience reports should carefully describe the context and provide a rich reflection on what worked, what didn't, and why. RESPECT 2019 will be organized as a joint meeting with RPPforCS, a community of awardees for NSF CS for ALL Researcher Practitioner Partnerships (RPP), and will be co-located with the ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) as a pre-symposium event on February 27, 2019 in Minneapolis, MN. As in previous editions of the conference, the RESPECT 2019 proceedings will be submitted for inclusion to IEEE Xplore and will be submitted for cross-indexing in the ACM Digital Library.</p> <p>Requires separate registration, visit <a href=""http://respect2019.stcbp.org/ "">their website</a> for more information.</p>",Jamie Payton and Tiffany Barnes,COLOCATED

2/27/2019,8:30 AM,5:00 PM,Pre-Symposium,CS Education Infrastructure for All II: Enabling the Change,Hyatt: Greenway E (2nd floor),"<p>CS Education makes heavy use of online educational tools like IDEs, Learning Management Systems (LMS), eTextbooks, and interactive programming environments. Many interactive, auto-assessed exercises, referred to as ""smart content"", are now available. Instructors and students would benefit from greater inter-operability between these tools. CS Education (CSEd) researchers increasingly make use of large collections of data generated by click streams coming from such tools. However, students, instructors, and researchers all face barriers that slow progress: (1) While the standards are improving, educational tools still do not integrate well. (2) Information about computer science learning process and outcome data generated by one system is not compatible with that from other systems. (3) Computer science problem solving and learning (e.g., open-ended coding solutions to complex problems) is quite different from the type of data (e.g., discrete answers to questions or verbal responses) that current educational data mining focuses on. This NSF-supported workshop is the second in a series of SIGCSE presymposium events in support of the SPLICE project. The goal of SPLICE is to support and better coordinate efforts to build community and capacity among CSEd researchers, data scientists, and learning scientists toward reducing barriers. CSEd infrastructure should support (1) broader re-use of innovative learning content instrumented for rich data collection, (2) formats and tools for analysis of learner data, and (3) development of best practices to make collections of learner data available to researchers. We will present progress on active collaborations and working groups, and plan activities for the coming year.</p><p>More info: <a href=""http://cssplice.org/SIGCSE19Workshop.html"">http://cssplice.org/SIGCSE19Workshop.html</a>.</p>",Clifford A.

2/27/2019,8:30 AM,5:00 PM,Pre-Symposium,POSSE Roundup,Hyatt: Greenway F (2nd floor),"<p>This workshop will explore approaches to student participation in HFOSS that provide more scaffolding and control for instructors taking initial steps with students. The discussion will focus on two areas: </p> <ul> <li>Sandbox HFOSS projects - Current software development tools allow snapshots of entire projects to be saved and then used to provide static ""sandbox"" environments to support demonstration and practice of HFOSS skills. These sandbox projects can be paired with community-developed learning activities to make it easier for instructors to teach open source skills and practices.</li> <li>Faculty-controlled HFOSS projects - There are a handful of cases where faculty are the core contributors to open source projects. Student participation in these projects may have a different dynamic that can improve predictability and instructor control over student participation. </li> </ul> <p>At the workshop, short presentations will summarize existing work in these areas. Breakout groups will generate ideas for application of these approaches in specific courses, and create specifications and prototypes of learning activities to support the identified uses.</p> <p>POSSE, the Professors’ Open Source Software Experience, prepares instructors to guide student participation in Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) projects. This POSSE Roundup is a workshop for instructors who have previously attended POSSE, or who have open source experience including contributing to an open source project.</p> <p>Additional information is available at: <a href='http://foss2serve.org/index.php/SIGCSE_2019_POSSE_Roundup'>http://foss2serve.org/index.php/SIGCSE_2019_POSSE_Roundup</a>.</p>",Gregory W Hislop; Grant Braught; Darci Burdge; Heidi Ellis; Stoney Jackson; Cameron Macdonell; Lori Postner,ALLDAY
2/27/2019,8:30 AM,5:00 PM,Pre-Symposium,Professional Development Workshop for Teaching-Track Faculty,Hyatt: Greenway J (2nd floor),"<p>Computer Science departments have experienced significant course enrollment increases and today many departments graduate the largest number of CS majors in their history. With fewer than a third of the new PhDs in CS seeking academic positions, the field faces a serious faculty shortage. Many Ph.D. granting departments have introduced or increased the number of academic teaching faculty positions that have academic rank and typically no tenure. The one-day workshop will focus on the professional development of teaching track faculty (professor of practice, instructor, clinical faculty, lecturer, etc.) in Ph.D. granting departments. The workshop fills a crucial need as many departments have limited experience on how to mentor, evaluate, and promote this new type of faculty. The sessions will focus on how teaching faculty can strategize their involvement in departmental as well as research activities, different forms of scholarship and leadership activities to pursue, and best practices for success, promotion, and advancement. Academic leaders involved in supervising and evaluating teaching track faculty will provide their perspective and insights.</p> <p><b>Intended Audience</b>: This event is targeted at teaching-track faculty in Ph.D. granting departments. The focus will be on TTF teaching large enrollment undergraduate courses and individuals relatively new to the teaching profession. It is not intended for graduate students, post-docs, individuals seeking a teaching position or individuals wanting to learn teaching practices and challenges. Some of the participants from the 2018 workshop will likely be panelists. We will give preference to applicants who have not previously participated, but we will not exclude repeat participants. </p> <p>To apply to attend the workshop or for more information, please go to: <a href=""https://cra.org/crae/activities/teaching-track-faculty-sigcse-2019/"">https://cra.org/crae/activities/teaching-track-faculty-sigcse-2019/</a></p>",Lori Pollock; Christine Alvarado; Barbara Ryder; Mark Sherriff,ALLDAY

2/27/2019,8:30 AM,12:00 PM,Pre-Symposium,Teaching Cybersecurity in CSP (or Any CS Class): Introducing the Security Mindset,Hyatt: Greenway A (2nd floor),"<p>Cybersecurity is vital to a technology-driven society. Daily headlines demonstrate that we cannot ignore the potential security risks inherent to our increasingly more networked lives. Cybersecurity is a growing job field -- but even for students that don't go on to pursue cybersecurity careers, it is crucial to have some level of security awareness! But until very recently, young people were usually not introduced to the intrigue and opportunity of cybersecurity until advanced undergraduate CS courses. However, the real world implications and applied nature of the topic lends itself well to engaging a wide audience, key to catching the interest of a diverse group of students in CS at a younger age.</p> <p>We have developed a series of lessons that introduce the broad idea of cybersecurity through threat modeling and the human-centered nature of authentication. They are prepared by subject-matter experts with research backgrounds in the technical workings and social implications of cybersecurity.  While our lessons were specifically designed to meet the cybersecurity learning objectives in the AP Computer Science Principles framework, they are appropriate for any high school computer science class.</p> <p>This will be an interactive workshop for CS educators at all levels; no previous cybersecurity experience required. (Laptops also optional.) Participants will learn how to begin developing the ""security mindset"" by teaching students a simplified version of threat modeling. We will also preview lessons on authentication and social engineering. In addition, the workshop will provide opportunities for attendees who teach cybersecurity learning objectives to share their own strategies.</p><p>More info: <a href=""http://teachingsecurity.org/sigcse-2019"">http://teachingsecurity.org/sigcse-2019</a></p>",Maritza Johnson; Daniel D.

CC2020 seeks to generate a modern revision of the well-known CC2005 document by reflecting a more current view of computing. Further, CC2020 proposes a competency-based characterization of computing, as well as a bottom-up organization of computing into its sub-disciplines based on an analysis of competencies. Existing computing disciplines for which curricular reports exist include computer engineering, computer science, cybersecurity information systems, information technology, and software engineering. Emerging computing disciplines are data science and artificial intelligence. This event imparts the results of the project to date and offers the opportunity for participants to infuse new ideas on the current computing disciplinary landscape, particularly as it relates to visualization models useful for industry, students, and academia.</p>",Alison Clear; Allen S Parrish; John Impagliazzo,AFTERNOON

2/27/2019,1:30 PM,5:00 PM,Pre-Symposium,"What!? You want me to include computing ethics, too!??!! Using the ACM Code of Ethics in technical computing topics",Hyatt: Greenway H (2nd floor),"<p>In the updated ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (http:ethics.acm.org), there is an explicit acknowledgment that ethical analysis is an essential part of computing professionalism. Developing this skill set requires giving students an early introduction and regular exposure to ethical considerations and reflective analysis of technical projects. One way to accomplish this is through the deliberate and proactive incorporation of the Code's values and guidance into all levels of existing curricula. Modifying technical exercises to provide regular exposure to ethical considerations and reflective analysis helps students move beyond the temptation to view “ethics” as a compliance check at the end of a project or course or someone else's responsibility.</p> <p>This session is designed to help educators use the Code to integrate ethical considerations into the technical learning objectives of a wide range of core technical courses. Ethical issues discussed in any class should naturally emerge from the class subject matter.  Using their own technical assignments, this session will address the needs of teachers and faculty who are tentative about incorporating computing ethics into existing technical courses. </p> <p>Using a mixture of lecture, small group activities, and discussion, we will present fundamental ethical concepts, methods for teaching computing ethics, and help participants apply strategies for modifying their existing assignments so that ethical considerations are learned along with technical topics. We will also discuss logistical concerns for teaching computing ethics, such as grading strategies.</p> <p>More info: <a href=""https://ethics.acm.org/sigcse2019"">https://ethics.acm.org/sigcse2019</a>.</p>",Don Gotterbarn; Michael S.

<p>Instructors often don't realize how complex CS courses have become (""feature creep""). zyBooks provide an outstanding interactive textbook; auto-grading homework system; and program auto-grader; all seamlessly integrated into ONE platform (with only one login -- or none via LMS integration). That's a key reason nearly all faculty come back; and why students ask to access our zyBooks even if their professor is using a different book. We'll show how our comprehensive solution leads to smooth courses that students love -- even if hard.</p>
<p>""I enjoy grading programs"" -- Said by nobody</p>
<p>CS is experiencing explosive growth; which pushes our grading resources to the limit. Auto-grading saves huge amounts of time. Students get more practice and immediate feedback; so they can improve quickly. We've learned how to do auto-grading even better; like with automated hints in homework problems; or using many small programs in CS1. We'll show how easy it is to create auto-graded programming assignments; and tell you about our large set of zyBooks-maintained labs -- so you can focus on the parts of teaching you really enjoy. </p>
