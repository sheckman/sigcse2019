Write your paper using the format specified above. Within the anonymized paper, you must provide Category and Subject Descriptors, General Terms, and Keywords based on the ACM classification system. These requirements are described in more detail in the [ACM publication guidelines]({{site.data.publishing.acmpubguidelines}}).

Please note that there are updated proceedings templates as of 2017.  Make sure you are using the updated versions of the templates.  We are using the `ACM_SigConf` template. Recall that you will also need to cut-and-paste or type your text abstract description into a text box during the submission process.

Be sure to choose the appropriate topic areas when submitting. Your choices, limited here to three (3), help in assigning appropriate reviewers to your submission, and assist the reviewers in evaluating the paper from an appropriate perspective.

{% elsif include.ispanel %}

<p>As Symposium and Program Chairs we wish to make it clear that we did NOT include the questions on gender and age in the author or reviewers details form in EasyChair, a form over which we have no control. The questions were set up automatically by EasyChair on a request from "ACM who sponsored this conference license". </p></strong>

<strong><p>The gender and age data is not visible to reviewers or authors and will not be used in any way in the process of reviewer selection, reviewer assignment, reviewing, decision making, or any conference planning.</p></strong>

<strong><p>When filling out the author or reviewer information, if you object to the collection of this information, please choose "Prefer not to submit." </p>
