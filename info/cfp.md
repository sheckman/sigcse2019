## Overview

The SIGCSE Technical Symposium is a forum for educators and researchers to share new results and insights around developing, implementing, or evaluating computing programs, curricula, and courses. Our 2019 conference celebrates the 50th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education! We are interested in honoring our history while sharing our vision of the next 50 years. We welcome submissions on the topics of computing education history, broadening participation and diversity, K-12 and novice learners, improved and scalable pedagogies, leveraging data and analytics to improve learning, peer learning and instruction, novel outreach, events and engagement strategies, involving students in solving social and global challenges, advanced CS topics, and education research. SIGCSE encourages multiple ways of sharing ideas, including [papers](#papers), [panels](#panels), [special sessions](#special-sessions), [workshops](#workshops), [ACM SRC](#acm-student-research-competition), [BoFs](#birds-of-a-feather), [Demos](#demos), [Lightning Talks](#lightning-talks), [Posters](#posters), [Nifty Assignments](#nifty-assignments), & [Pre­symposium Events](#pre-symposium-events). We invite colleagues from around the world to contribute to, review for, and attend SIGCSE 2019. 

**AUTHORS TAKE NOTE**: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library.  This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference.  The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  (For those rare conference whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)

### Papers
 
[Papers](../authors/papers) describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool. All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the interventions, including limitations. Initial submissions must be anonymous. **Note that an ABSTRACT SUBMISSION is required for all papers and it is due a week before the full paper is due.**

  * **CS Education Research** papers should adhere to rigorous standards, describing hypotheses, methods, results, and limitations as is typical for research studies. These normally focus on topics relevant to computing education with emphasis on educational goals and knowledge units/topics relevant to computing education with statistical rigor; methods or techniques in computing education; evaluation of pedagogical approaches; and studies of the many populations engaged in computing education, including (but not limited to) students, instructors, and issues of gender, diversity, and underrepresentation. 
  * **Experience Reports and Tools** papers should carefully describe a computer science education intervention and its context, and provide a rich reflection on what worked, what didn’t, and why. This track accepts experience reports, teaching techniques, and pedagogical tools. All papers in this track should provide enough detail for adoption by others. 
  * **New Curricula, Programs, Degrees, and Position Papers**. Papers about curricula, programs, and degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken, what it took to put the initiative into place, what the impact has been, and suggestions for others wishing to adopt it. Position papers are meant to engender fruitful academic discussion by presenting a defensible opinion about a CS education topic, substantiated with evidence.

Papers may contain up to {{site.data.cfp.details.Papers.limits}}.  Accepted papers will be included in the proceedings.  Authors of accepted papers will have a presentation of {{site.data.cfp.details.Papers.length}} at the conference.

### Panels

[Panels](../authors/panels) present multiple perspectives on a specific topic. Panel proposals include a topic description, panelists, affiliations, panelist position statements, and a plan for audience participation.

Panel proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details.Panels.limits}} maximum and accepted panels will be included in the proceedings.  Panels will be provided a session of {{site.data.cfp.details.Panels.length}} at the conference.

### Special Sessions

[Special sessions](../authors/specialsessions) are your opportunity to design a unique 75­-minute session in a standard conference space, but distinct from papers, panels, posters, or BoFs.

Special session proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details["Special Sessions"].limits}} maximum and accepted special sessions will be included in the proceedings.  Special sessions will be provided a session of {{site.data.cfp.details["Special Sessions"].length}} at the conference.

### Workshops

[Workshops](../authors/workshops) engage participants in learning new techniques and technologies designed to foster education, scholarship, and collaboration. Proposals must include an abstract, advertisement, intended audience and size, and specify power/A/V/equipment/space needs. Workshops do not conflict with the technical sessions.

Workshop proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details.Workshops.limits}} maximum.  Accepted workshop abstracts will be included in the proceedings.  Workshops will be provided a session of {{site.data.cfp.details.Workshops.length}}.

### Nifty Assignments

[Nifty Assignments](../authors/nifty) promote and share successful assignment ideas with enough materials available for others to adopt and adapt for their use. Proposals must include a short writeup describing the assignment, target population, strength and weaknesses, and what computing concept it teaches.

See the Nifty site for instructions on making up your submission: {{site.data.cfp.details["Nifty Assignments"].limits}}

Accepted Nifty abstracts will be included in the proceedings as part of the Nifty paper.  For details about a Nifty submission, see {{site.data.cfp.details["Nifty Assignments"].limits}}.

### Birds of a Feather

[BoFs](../authors/bofs) provide an environment for colleagues with similar
interests to meet for informal discussions. A/V equipment will not be provided for BoFs.

BoF proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details["Birds of a Feather"].limits}} maximum.  Accepted BoF abstracts will be included in the proceedings.  BoFs will be provided a session of {{site.data.cfp.details["Birds of a Feather"].length}}.

### Posters

[Posters](../authors/posters) describe CS education materials or research, particularly works in progress.
Posters enable one­on­one discussion with conference attendees. Prepared handouts are encouraged.

Posters proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details["Posters"].limits}} maximum.  Accepted poster abstracts will be included in the proceedings.  Posters will be provided a session of {{site.data.cfp.details["Posters"].length}}.

### Demos

[Demos](../authors/demos) showcase the relevance, potential, and innovation of a tool and allow time for
discussion with its creator in the exhibition hall. Proposals include an abstract and specify power/A/V/space needs.

Demos proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details["Demos"].limits}} maximum.  Accepted demo abstracts will be included in the proceedings.  Demos will be provided a session of {{site.data.cfp.details["Demos"].length}}.


### Lightning Talks

[Lightning talks](../authors/lightningtalks) describe works in progress, new and untested ideas, or
opportunities for collaborative work. Talks are an excellent way to spark discussions and get feedback on an idea.

Lightning Talks proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details["Lightning Talks"].limits}} maximum.  Accepted lightning talk abstracts will be included in the proceedings.  Lightning Talks will be provided a presentation of {{site.data.cfp.details["Lightning Talks"].length}}.

### ACM Student Research Competition

Undergraduate and graduate student
ACM members are invited to submit individual research contributions from the area of computer science education to the  [ACM Student Research Competition](../authors/src).

SRC proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details["Demos"].limits}} maximum.  Accepted SRC abstracts will be included in the proceedings.  SRC posters are presented during a 3-hour poster session that overlaps a break. Authors of selected posters will be invited to give a 25-minute presentation during an SRC session.

### Pre-Symposium Events

Affiliated organizations are invited to submit proposals for events, including target audience, # participants, duration, topic, schedule, power/A/V/space needs, and organizers.  Organizations may request a half day (4-hours) or full day (8-hours) event.  Pre-symposium event organizers are expected to cover the cost of the room, food, and/or A/V through attendance registration fees or pre-symposium event organizer budgets. Cost information will be available on the conference website.
