SIGCSE addresses gender issues in computing year after year.  At DePauw University, we learned from SIGCSE's lessons – and those taught by ACM's Council on Women in Computing – and recently awarded 47% of our computer science undergraduate degrees to women.  This talk provides a rapid-fire countdown of ten of our most effective strategies that created our 47% class.
