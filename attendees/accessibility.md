The SIGCSE community is becoming increasingly diverse, with attendees from all over the world who represent varied gender, racial, ethnic, disability, and other identities. This year, we are happy to provide a Frequently Asked Questions page to help you navigate accessibility at the conference. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please contact the Accessibility Liaison, Stacy Branham, at [accessibility@sigcse2019.org](mailto:accessibility@sigcse2019.org), and/or take a moment to fill out this [brief accessibility and inclusivity survey](https://goo.gl/forms/EyvKHLdYgL1WaySA2) to help us improve.  

**Q: Are there all-gender restrooms?**

A: Yes, there will be an all-gender restroom located past the registration desk and down the hall on the right. It is immediately adjacent to the Grant Room.

**Q: Is there a room for nursing mothers?**

A: Yes. The Hyatt hotel has a designated “Mothering room,” which is located on the second floor. If you visit the front desk, they can provide you with a key. Access is first come, first served.
