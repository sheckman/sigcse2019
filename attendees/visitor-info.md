## Transportation by Rail/Bus from Airport to Hotel

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/minn-light-rail.png" alt="A minimal map of the Minneapolis light rail. The page text is ample to get you from the airport to the hotel area." style="float:right;">

From the airport to the hotel, you will board at Terminal 1 (Lindbergh) or Terminal 2 (Humphrey). Any BLUE line train towards Minneapolis or Target Field will work. You want to get off at Nicollet Mall. Fare is roughly $1.75.

From the light rail stop, you *could* walk the eight blocks to the hotel; this might be a decision to be made based on weather. It might be preferable to catch a bus. Below is an embedded Google Map that demonstrates that, even by US public transportation standards, this is a simple transfer and bus ride. It appears that the number 10, 17, and 18 busses run every 4-8 minutes, and it is an 8-10 minute ride.

The #10 may (from the webmaster's read...) be a free ride from the Metro station to the convention center.

## Transport by Taxi, etc.

The airport is roughly 12 miles from the hotel. Taxis will cost around $40.

The Uber website claims you can [uber](https://www.uber.com/airports/msp/) from the airport. Different kinds of Uber exist (who knew?), and they cost different amounts. An UberX is estimated (by the Uber website) to be $20. An UberXL might run closer to $40, and an Uber Black SUV (?!) might cost as much as $70.

## Coffee

For some, coffee is critical. Google Maps links provided for some potential caffeine destinations.

* [Caribou Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/afPN6YtDKYy): 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, MN 55402 
* [Starbucks](https://goo.gl/maps/e1SCbgCsxu62): 1101 Lasalle Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55403 

There also seems to be a highly rated cr&ecirc;perie not far from the hotel. Just to make sure that we don't overrun the shop, you might decide to tell yourself that the reviews are certainly fake, and therefore not worth the effort of exploring. 

* [La Belle Crepe](https://goo.gl/maps/q3ogyTggqCE2): 825 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, MN 55402

(Doing a Google Maps search for "coffee" centered on the hotel turned up many more venues.)
