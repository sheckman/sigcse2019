## Emergency Services

There will be an EMT onsite during the conference. If you need to check any arrangements in advance, you should reach out to the Hennepin County Medical Center, which is the nearest medical facility to the conference hotel. Their address is 701 Park Avenue, Minneapolis, MN, 55414.

## The Hotel

Some [details about our hotel](files/hyatt-overview.pdf).

## The Airport

A [map of the airport](files/airport-map.pdf) (PDF)!

## Transportation by Rail/Bus from Airport to Hotel

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/minn-light-rail.png" alt="A minimal map of the Minneapolis light rail. The page text is ample to get you from the airport to the hotel area." style="float:right;">

This [handy transportation card](files/transportation-card.pdf) provides an overview (PDF).

From the airport to the hotel, you will board at Terminal 1 (Lindbergh) or Terminal 2 (Humphrey). Any BLUE line train towards Minneapolis or Target Field will work. You want to get off at Nicollet Mall. Fare is roughly $1.75.

From the light rail stop, you *could* walk the eight blocks to the hotel; this might be a decision to be made based on weather. It might be preferable to catch a bus. Below is an embedded Google Map that demonstrates that, even by US public transportation standards, this is a simple transfer and bus ride. It appears that the number 10, 17, and 18 busses run every 4-8 minutes, and it is an 8-10 minute ride.

The #10 may (from the webmaster's read...) be a free ride from the Metro station to the convention center.

## Transport by Taxi, etc.

The airport is roughly 12 miles from the hotel. Taxis will cost around $40.

The Uber website claims you can [uber](https://www.uber.com/airports/msp/) from the airport. Different kinds of Uber exist (who knew?), and they cost different amounts. An UberX is estimated (by the Uber website) to be $20. An UberXL might run closer to $40, and an Uber Black SUV (?!) might cost as much as $70.

There is also Lyft, and there are Lyft/Uber signs at the airport to help you find many kinds of crowdsourced transportation.

## Coffee

For some, coffee is critical. Google Maps links provided for some potential caffeine destinations.

* [Caribou Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/afPN6YtDKYy): 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, MN 55402 
* [Starbucks](https://goo.gl/maps/e1SCbgCsxu62): 1101 Lasalle Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55403 

There also seems to be a highly rated cr&ecirc;perie not far from the hotel. Just to make sure that we don't overrun the shop, you might decide to tell yourself that the reviews are certainly fake, and therefore not worth the effort of exploring. 

* [La Belle Crepe](https://goo.gl/maps/q3ogyTggqCE2): 825 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, MN 55402

(Doing a Google Maps search for "coffee" centered on the hotel turned up many more venues.)
