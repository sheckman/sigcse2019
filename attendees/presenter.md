## Presentation Guidelines

Please follow the [SIGACCESS Guidelines](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-presentation-guide/) to create a presentation that all attendees can enjoy and learn from.  We summarize the [linked SIGACCESS guidelines](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-presentation-guide/) and add a few more below:

* Choose a high contrast color scheme that supports color blind readers,
* Use more than color coding to communicate information,
* Keep text brief,
* Keep graphics simple and be verbally describe images, animations, videos,
* Avoid using a pointer,
* Caption videos,
* Speak clearly, use a microphone, face the audience, and use common, understandable terms,
* Post your slides early,
* Share your contact information, and
* Download your slides, videos, and sounds locally on your computer; don't depend on wifi for your presentation.


Remember to follow [SIGCSE Conference Policies](https://sigcse2019.sigcse.org/policies.html) and the [ACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment). 

As speakers at SIGCSE, show respect to others by:

* keeping to time limits,
* preparing presentations in advance,
* listening to questions,
* using the microphone so everyone can hear, and
* repeating questions so the audience can hear.

Speakers are role models.  As such, promote connections between attendees and engage with attendees on stage and off.
