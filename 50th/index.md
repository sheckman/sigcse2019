## {{page.title}}

In 2019, we will be celebrating the 50th SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  We will have dedicated sessions within the conference program to celebrate our 50-symposia history.  Come see our booth in the exhibit hall and stay tuned for other events that focus on our history and look ahead towards the next 50 symposia. 

Additional information about the history of the symposia and the SIGCSE organization is available [via the SIGCSE website](https://sigcse.org/sigcse/events/50years).
